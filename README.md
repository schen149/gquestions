## Installation
Currently the code requires a chrome browser on your machine. 
If you are familiar with the `selenium` library, you can change `gquestions.py` code to work with different browsers. The rest of the instructions assume that you are working with Chrome.  
#### Step 1: Download `ChromeDriver` and place it under `driver/`
Check the version of your chrome browser (in `setting` -> `About Chrome`), and download the matching version of driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/.

#### Step 2: Start with a fresh python 3.7 environment and install the required packages
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Verify the installation with an example query
Search "flights" in English and export in csv (under `csv/`)
```
python gquestions.py query "flights" en --csv
```
## üîç Usage:
To make a single query: 
```
python gquestions.py query <keyword> (en|es) [depth <depth>] [--csv] [--headless]
```
To process a batch of queries -- Put the queries in a line separated file (see `perspectrum_claims.txt` for example), and run:
```
bash extract.sh <input-file>
```

To print help message --
```
python gquestions.py (-h | --help)
```
## How to read the csv results
The output csv file has four columns:
- id: 
- parent: The query you put in the search bar
- name: The first-level "people also ask" entries that appears for the query.
- inner.name: Additional "people also ask" items that popped up after clicking on the first-level entries. 


## Advanved Usage Examples:

Search headlessly "flights" in English and export in html
```
python gquestions.py query "flights" en --headless   

```

Search "vuelos" in Spanish and export in html and csv
```
python gquestions.py query "vuelos" es --csv
```

Search "vuelos" in Spanish with a depth of 1 and export in html
```
python gquestions.py query "vuelos" es depth 1 
```

Advanced use: using operators with queries:

```
python gquestions.py query '"vpn" site:https://protonmail.com/blog' en --csv
```
